## ðŸš€ Our Workflow

This project is a collaboration between a human Architect (you) and an AI Agent (Kael).

1.  The Architect provides high-level goals and requirements.
2.  The AI Agent generates the necessary code, scripts, and configurations.
3.  The Architect reviews the generated code and commits it to this repository.

This repository serves as the single source of truth for the Kael OS project.
